# Security Fixes and Improvements - Firefox Edition

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the Reprompt-It Firefox extension.

## Critical Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Storage Key Inconsistencies
**Issue**: Different files used inconsistent storage key names, preventing proper communication between components.
- `background.js` used: `OPENAI_KEY`, `GOOGLE_KEY`, `PROVIDER`, etc.
- `popup.js` and `options.js` used: `openaiKey`, `geminiKey`, `defaultProvider`, etc.

**Fix**: Standardized all storage keys across all files to use camelCase convention and `browser.storage.local` API.

### 2. Firefox Manifest V2 Security
**Issue**: Extension was using Chrome Manifest V3 which is not compatible with Firefox.

**Fix**: 
- Converted to Firefox-compatible Manifest V2 format
- Updated permissions to be more specific for Firefox
- Added host permissions for API endpoints
- Used background scripts instead of service workers

### 3. Browser API Compatibility
**Issue**: Extension used Chrome-specific `chrome.*` APIs not available in Firefox.

**Fix**:
- Converted all API calls to use `browser.*` namespace
- Updated script injection to use `browser.tabs.executeScript`
- Modified message passing to use Firefox-compatible methods

### 4. Insecure API Key Storage
**Issue**: API keys were stored in `browser.storage.sync` which syncs across devices and is less secure.

**Fix**: Switched to `browser.storage.local` for all sensitive data including API keys.

### 5. Unvalidated API Responses
**Issue**: API responses were directly injected into web pages without sanitization, creating XSS vulnerabilities.

**Fix**: 
- Added `sanitizeText()` function to remove HTML tags and dangerous content
- Added `validateResponse()` function to check for suspicious patterns
- Added response length validation

### 6. Missing Input Validation
**Issue**: No validation on API key format or user inputs.

**Fix**: 
- Added format validation for OpenAI keys (must start with 'sk-')
- Added format validation for Gemini keys (must start with 'AIza')
- Added minimum length checks
- Added input sanitization for user inputs

### 7. Poor Error Handling
**Issue**: Silent failures and poor user feedback for errors.

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Added proper error messages to users
- Replaced alerts with toast notifications
- Added specific error handling for different failure scenarios

### 9. Firefox-Specific Security Enhancements
**Issue**: Extension needed Firefox-specific security considerations.

**Fix**:
- Added gecko application ID for proper Firefox identification
- Configured content scripts with proper run_at timing
- Added host permissions for external API calls
- Removed ES6 modules for better Firefox compatibility
- Converted from service worker to background script for better security context

## Security Improvements Made

### Input Sanitization
- All user inputs are trimmed and sanitized
- Dangerous characters removed: `<>\"'&`
- API key format validation implemented

### Response Validation
- HTML tag removal from API responses
- Script tag detection and removal
- Suspicious pattern detection
- Response length validation

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error catching and logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper timeout handling
- Network error handling

### Permission Minimization
- Reduced web accessible resources scope
- Added only necessary permissions
- Removed overly broad access patterns

## Testing Recommendations

1. **API Key Validation**: Test with invalid API keys to ensure proper error handling
2. **Response Sanitization**: Test with malicious API responses containing HTML/scripts
3. **Timeout Handling**: Test with slow/unresponsive API endpoints
4. **Storage Consistency**: Verify settings are properly saved and loaded across all interfaces
5. **Error Display**: Verify error messages are displayed properly to users

## Security Best Practices Implemented

- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Output encoding and sanitization  
- ✅ Proper error handling without information leakage
- ✅ Secure storage of sensitive data
- ✅ Request timeouts for reliability
- ✅ Minimal permissions principle
- ✅ Content Security Policy compliance

## Next Steps

1. Add logging for security events (optional)
2. Consider implementing API key encryption at rest (advanced security)
3. Regular security audits of dependencies
4. Monitor for new Chrome extension security best practices

**Note**: Rate limiting is not implemented as users control their own API keys and usage. Short text rephrasing requests are infrequent and user-initiated, making rate limiting unnecessary for this use case.
